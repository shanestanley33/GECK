If you have not synced your code at any time during the 7 parts, you won’t have any commits made by me and can thus skip this section.

So that you don’t have commits made by your me, let’s reset the local repo:

rm -rf .git
git init
Next, commit your code as it stands:

git add -A
git commit -m "MERN-Stack Infrastructure"
